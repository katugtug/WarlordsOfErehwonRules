The flesh recoils from her iron halls.

Urlexian compound description >> There is more on trello that did not come to pass.

The Urlexians have a diffuse work structure, with workers going about their business gathering wood and other organics and bringing it back to central 'furnaces'. These furnaces slowly languorously belch out smoke in great plumes. They are making charcoal. The finished charcoal is then being piled into a large pile in a central location, it's a pile of black charcoal at least 100x100ft. 

Beyond this structure in the distance, a road of pounded dirt (an Urlexian with giant pounding arms can be see pounding it flat.)

The PCs may, if they wish travel along this road and take in the great destruction. There are no trees. This is dead foliage, black earth and a network of blackened iron structures. Everything is made of some kind of metal. Small "mites" about the size of small dogs move around.

Urlexian organisms have a heart, a glowing orange piece of metal in their center. Urlexians can also store energy in non-organism cores, power cores that can be transported. These mites have hearts, there are larger workers around which also do. The structures, not all of their uses apparent, do not have hearts, but most have a glowing component or 2, glowing like hot iron.

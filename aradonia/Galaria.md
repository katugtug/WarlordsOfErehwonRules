The nobles lords of Galaria have held court in the Great Arcoithilon for a millenia. An unbroken linage has passed the crown without bloodshed for 300 years. 

== Military ==
Every noble is trained from birth in sword and lance, taught to ride a horse as soon as they can stand. Galarian nobles have a strong military tradition that means they can field expert man-at-arms in far greater numbers than [[Aradonia]] could ever, now or then. Their cavalry are unmatched and their swordsmanship in particular is the standard of the world. However, recent advances in military technology, most notably professional soldiers in well drilled pike formations, more powerful crossbows and the increasing prevalence of firearms, most developed in a direct response to Galarian dominance, has left the nation's armies at a disadvantage. 

== Leadership ==
Galaria is ruled by King Husted VII, a ruthless and vengeful dictator. His primary goal is to bring Aradonia to it's knees for their stunning victory at the Battle of Westerbrook, where Aradonian mercenaries purported backed by the [[Council of High Lords]], supported a slave rebellion. Aradonian quarrelers from a high position over a muddy valley defeated an equal force of Galarian men-at-arms, bloodying the nose of Galaria and starting a new era of Aradonian led politics in the region.

Beyond the world, there is a place of seething cosmic force. A hell of stars, forming and reforming where each moment births a hundred realities and sunders a hundred more. There is no law here, there is no order. In this other-place are formed intelligences, alien intelligences with desires and needs.

The art and music, the prayers and wars of humanity are mocked here. They are emulated in caricature, as light reflecting on a broken mirror, picked up by cruel actors as a jester's marotte. Mankind's earthly realities are reflected endlessly into a void of reflecting, distorted realities, forever descending into madness.

The souls of the dead, screaming out of the world, are pursued as mice are pursued by snakes. They are swallowed up and digested.

This is the conduit through which man must experience spirituality on this world. In this chaos, men must find their gods. From this place, man must pull his magic. Into this place, he must go when he dies, to be devoured or possibly lost forever.

In many ways, the souls of the dead are the raw stuff of creation in this plane. The brightest soul reflects into the void indefinitely; from nothing, this soul of man creates something. The soul is the light, it is the furnace of this hell and the source of its action.

In this teeming chaos, a few beings, at least for now, cling to an island of reality they have fashioned or found. These are the gods. They are intelligences of an entirely un-human origin. But their desire is all the same: to capture souls. The methods and practices they employ to achieve their goal vary widely.

Sorcerers are men and women privy to the dark secrets of the eldritch unknown. Their power comes from their blood and the understanding of things best left unknown. Driven mad by their desires, sorcerers are unjust rulers, cruelly taking what they want from the populations that huddle beneath their rule.

Magic isn’t inherently evil, but it inherently corruptive. To understand magic’s fickle nature, one must forfeit some of their understanding of their humanity. A glimpse of the shimmering eldritch cosmos turns the heart away from the coarse desires of humanhood. Those who wield magic are all eventually consumed by it. But the power that magic grants is undeniable. Entire armies may be destroyed in a terrific lightning storm or all together swallowed into the earth in a massive fissure.

Likewise, the priests of the fell lords are also above the cares of the mortal world. They do as their dark lord bids them. To disobey the wishes of these dark gods is to be hunted by your own, if not slain outright by the dark powers at work.

== Gods of Hell ==

The world of the gods in inscrutable to men. But in the dark hours of the night, in the flickering of a candle or the vastness of a dark sky, the Gods may speak to men. And above all, they are hungry.

To feel the talk of a being from beyond, to have a god (if indeed they are gods)reveal to you, is an experience known as revelation. The point of first contact, the point which your humanhood ends and the divinity begins, that is indeed a transformative moment.

Unfortunately, the gods are especially cruel in their demands.

A multitude of cults and creeds have developed but the end is always the same. Ritual sacrifice, especially human, to sate the gods thirst, to gain their favor and to manifest them on the earth.

Gods use gifts as a fisher uses lures. They draw men to their cults with promises mostly left unkept, but strong enough to cause men to swear their souls to some dark end. 

== Planes ==

The planes sit on top of each other, like layers of paper. They all reflect versions of the same world. Sorcerors can draw power from these planes, opening holes between the planes and causing temporary bridges to form, bringing the stuff of one plane into the next.

Teresta - our world, the world of sunlight and water and life as we know it.

Urlexia - The iron world of Urlexia where metal lives. The flesh recoils from her iron halls.

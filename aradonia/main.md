= Overview =

The Aradonian year is 23,126. A new land has been discovered, a thousand miles across a dangerous sea, a land called [[Orentis]]. Churchfolk, merchants, mercenaries, armies and many others make their way there now, to ply their trade, to win fortune and glory or to do the bidding of their kings. [[Orentis]] is not new to settlement. In its forests and hills, a parallel history to that of [[Grachis]] where scores of civilizations have risen and fallen on its shores. Pioneers of all sorts make land in [[Barrett's Hold]] and set off for the inland. You're one of them. Good luck.

= Old World Nations =

* [[Illyria]]  - A fractured land of warring trade kingdoms.  
* [[Aradonia]] - A high technology guild driven society run by dwarves.  
* [[Galaria]]  - A great feudal nation with an ancient monarchy.

=Races and Peoples=

* [[Aradonia|Aradonians]] Proud technologically sophisticated cosmopolitan society. Primarily Dwarves.
* [[Hollowguard]] Ancient automatons from the fallen civilization of [[Arelion|Shattered Arelion]].
* [[Tidefolk]] Brutal crabpeople from the sea.
* [[Illyria|Illyrian Minotaurs]] From distant Illyria, the bull headed mariners come to ply their trade. Illyrians and their neighbors have had a rough history, but in the modern day, trade has made the Illyrians rich and has made them friends of a sort with their neighbors.
* [[Zith]] Social chameleons with no established society, these insect people can be found most anywhere.
* [[Galaria|Galarians]] Driven by the whip, this strong feudal nation competes with Aradonia for trade and power.


==The languages of [[Grachis]] in the modern day==

[[Aradonia|Aradonian]] - The language of the dwarves and at this point in history, the predominant language of the land. Drawing from ancient Dwarven rune languages and using the same alphabet, modern Aradonian differs greatly from Aradonian from only a 100 years ago. Originally a language steeped in metaphor, where a single rune might have a score of meanings based on context, each rune crafted and struck with purpose and restraint, carefully chosen. Every rune fit to be chiseled into stone. Non dwarven readers have taken the language and run with it, destroying its sparsity with thousands of new words, but creating the defacto language of the land, a language uniquely suited to trade and craftsmanship, now with newly bolted on non-dwarven ideals. Many humans have Galarian origins and bring many of those words in.

[[Galaria|Galarian]] - Galarian is a sweeping language with long vowels, a mixture of the original Juli people from the southwest and ancient Utril migrations from the Fangs into the fertile Galarian lands. Much of Galarian finds its way into modern Aradonian through ancient human and ogre refuges into Aradonia. But in Galaria, almost exclusively pure Galarian is spoken.

[[Illyria|Illyrian]] - Rumbling low language, Illyrian is suited to the lower vocal range of the massive minotaurs who speak it. Illyrians have many dialects, scattered across a wide range of kingdoms.

Tidefolk have a form of communication others call Tidespeak, but it relies on specific anatomy. 

===Other locales===
[[Kurshi]] peoples have an family of languages which are related but rarely seen in Grachis.

Rarely seen are [[Ho Tai]], a race of shorter, furry mountain humanoids. The language is unique, but occurs rarely in Grachis. It is shared amongst a number of the [[Great Fangs]] peoples.

=Cosmology =
[[Cosmology|The Universe]] is cruel, a swirling hell of darkness and stars and souls on the run from hungry gods. Islands in this expanse are the realms of the gods.

=Magic=
Magic comes from the swirling cosmos, a chaotic mess of raw insight, raw creation, raw power. Those who wield serious magic (aka [[Sorcery]] are generally distrusted. The [[Catastrophe at Malite]] and other such events have led to a general public distrust of sorcerers and their ilk. Practicing magic is considered foolhardy and only the providence of those who 'know what they are doing', court wizards and the like. 

There is a lesser form of magic, tricks of the hand, cantrips, folk magic. These sorts of magic are generally safe, passed down, and taught across all social strata.

A third type of magic is less understood, generally known as primitive magic or earth magic. It centers around the power of patterns and rituals. It is a slow path to power and draws from something other than the stars. It is not flashy. To kill a man, cosmic magic, to stop rainfall and kill his country, earth magic.


=Technology=
==War==
Heavy armor dominates the battlefield. Heavy cavalry is the primary form of military combat in the last 100 years. However, as a response to this, the rise of the professional soldier is underway. Square pike formations have developed as an answer to the cavalry charge and are very effective. Missile troops, bowmen and crossbowmen play a big part as well. Firearms have been developed and are attached in small numbers to pike formations to add some ranged punch to them. Pike formations are extremely vulnerable due to the length of their weapons. Being able to change formation effectively in the heat of battle and hold the line against cavalry charges is the more important aspect.

Men-at-arms and knights who have dominated for a 100 years find themselves less effective. Armies grow and grow, professional battle hardened mercenaries are easy to find. Warfare is moving away from bring strictly the providence of the rich and landed and into the peasantry.

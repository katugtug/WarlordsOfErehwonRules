The ship type of the era is the galley, that is long slender vessels, powered by oarsmen primarily and usually square rigged sails for harnessing some wind power. These vessels are reliable as they do not rely entirely on the wind, they can make amphibious landings due to oar power, and can quickly turn and manuever in fighting or navigating the coast.

Warships of this time consist of highcastles with bowmen or crossbowmen, providing them with cover and a high position to shoot other ships and crew. 

For ocean travel, ships must rely more on sail power. Smaller exploratory ships of this type are about 50m long, with their primary mode being sail power. A ship of this kind can travel between 50 to 75 miles per day.

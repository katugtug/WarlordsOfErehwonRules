# Knights Vs Gnolls: Part 2: NIGHT RAID
## Goal 
Knights defend barn from being burnt and houses from being raided.

**Gnolls** burn down the barn raid as many houses as possible

## Setup 
Setup city one barn 5 buildings and a bar

## Orders
Knights have 3 dice starting must be minimum sized units.
Gnolls have 4 dice total but have vengeful special rule.
Must bring matriarch and surviving guards as 2 units.

## Special rules
**Pitch black** Line of sight is 10 inches 

**Patrol**: Number the houses and barn 1 through 6 barn being 6 knights make advance orders towards a random house until they view a gnoll unit

**Raise the alarm**: If a knight unit survives a combat engagement against a gnoll unit they raise the alarm causing the bar to empty its contents containing the surviving members of the raid and 1 more full unit of peasants. if the barn is caught on fire this happens automatically. The knight units deployed from the bar are zealous as they have been drinking heavily and in high spirits.

Houses are **raided** if a gnoll unit start a turn in contact with a house, if they are

**Barn is lit** if a gnoll guard unit or matriarch rallies in contact with the barn remove one model from the guard unit if they do or one wound from the matriarch. 

6 turns to play before the knights gather too many units to continue the raid.

## Post Battle
The barn will affect the ability to deploy horses in the upcoming battles

Houses will determine an overall victory if over half the houses are raided the gnolls will feel victorious.

# Calendar Thoughts

Twin sun? Seems fun.

# County of Dirk

The county Dirk is a large rural province in southern Aradonia. It's borders stretch all the way to the Fangs, but this area is thinly inhabited, it's village small and its farmland rocky. It has no real exports, no gold, no silver and no silks. Those who live here have a hard life, w. The **Count of Dirk, Count Reginald Royce** makes his home in 

# Points of Interest

## The Halls of Grunduk
Hundreds of years ago, dwarves carved deep into the mountain here, mining deep into the earth and amassing great treasures. One of their many treasures drew the attention of a great red dragon, who has taken up residence in the Halls of Grunduk, making them his own. The dwarves were defeated and the Halls of Grunduk lay silent now, except the for the great dragon. Many adventurers make their way here (all of that treasure!), but none return; the Dragon does not suffer visitors.

## The Aberrant Fog
Decades ago, a great plumes of smoke started to spew from great fissures in the ground. The gas is breathable though barely, but it causes weirdness and chaos. Mutants and aberations now pollute a wind carried stretch from the fissure. It's continued for 30 years, no one knows why and those who seek it out never return.

# NPCS of Note

## The Archmage Chronos Alune

A powerful wizard who has guided those goodly sorts who seek his council for generations. He knowledge is great and his intelligence network even greater. Always an ally of the Galarians and their king, his council is seen an infallible. His purposes are his own, secret and weird. He sends adventurers to do things like paint sigils on ancient runes. Can he guide the Galarians through recent troubles?

## Galarian King Bederain II

The noble king of Galaria, his kingdom rifted by civil war and threats from all sides, rotted from the inside by buearucrats and merchant lords, attacked from the outside by great greenskin hordes, beset by terrible plagues and famine, Galaria staggers from its former greatness.

Bederain is better than his father, Bederain I, who allowed the kingdom to rot to civil war. Bederain II 43 years old, his family killed by plague. He will give missions to stop threats to the throne; there are many threats of all sorts.

## The Dwarf King, Kythus Kragbrow

Their home has been overrun by dark elves and worse, the ancient dwarven city of Underhome. They now defend their mountains from near-surface settlements, the largest and most well defending being Sunforge. Dwarves are bearing the brunt the eastern hordes, losing dwarven lives in what seems to be a defense of Galarian farmlands. But hold firm they still do.

Kythus Kragbrow will send adventurers to ask the Galarians for aid in defending their eastern border. He will send parties east of the mountains to scout on greenskin forces. He will send adventurers into the mountains to discover more of Underhome. 

Kythus Kragbrow is a devout servant of Moradin the King Below and his faith guides his actions. 

## The Dark Crusader Sevestus

Sevestus arrived from across the sea with an army at his back just in time to save the beleagured defenders of Fort Duboien from certain defeat at the hands of an army of rampaging demons who appeared from no where. His army immediately marched east to portal and his forces closed it. Regarded as a hero by some, he set up shop here, erecting a fortification and camping in the County Duboien -- where he still camps today. His fortress, now famous for it's great bonelike spire, has only grown. The fortress sits at a potent ley line intersection.

His followers are dark in aspect, cloaked figures covered in foreign markings and thick armor. In battle, they summon terrible magical attacks, capable of smashing aside armored columns and devouring horsemen whole. 

Sevestus' agents roam Galaria, looking for something arcane and secret. They occassionally threaten monastraries and the like and appear to be scouring much of the written works of Galaria... for something.

Despite Sevestus occupying a Galarian county, King Bederain has not acted against him, mainly on the advice of the Archmage Chronos.

Sevestus does the bidding of a number of dark gods and seeks information to summon them / and or free them from their prisons. He seeks to stave off destruction of this world by rampaging chaos, only so that he can deliver it to his masters.

## The Liche
Hundreds of years ago, Malgos the Dread King was defeated by an alliance of elves, dwarves and humans. Mortally wounded, he escaped, only to complete a ritual to extend his life as an undead liche. His both withered but his determiniaton to see the elves, dwarves and humans ground to dust did not. 

He wants to restore his empire and claim the rightful throne of the Galarian kingdom as his own. He sometimes realizes that ruling and destroying are different.

He raises an army of undead to do his bidding in the dark and forgotten places of the world.

His apprentices scour ruins and sewers for corpses and artifacts. He maintains a network of portals that allow him to travel throughout the kingdom instantly.  His missions are things like spying on the archmage and undoing his plans and recovering secrets from his ancient homeland in the great south, now covered in ice.

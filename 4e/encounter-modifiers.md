# Interesting Encounter Modifiers

## The Setting


1. **Endless Hordes** Enemies continue to come assault the party, no matter how many you kill. You must close them off, complete a ritual, or escape in order to win this fight.

3. **Hold the Gate** Opponents attempt to scale a wall or breach a gate, where the narrow hall gives him a big advantage.

3. **Convince the gatekeeper** A gatekeeper holds the means of escape and he is a third party. The party is being attacked by a 2nd party and convincing, intimidating or otherwise persuading the gatekeeper may be the means of escape / success.

4. **Hidden assailants** While the party is unaware, a group of sneaky individuals attempt to eliminate the party members one at a time.

5. **Puzzle fight** An puzzle encounter involving a secret message and floor tiles while at the same time fighting an encounter.

## Terrain

1. **Elevation** - There's a raised area on the battlefield, maybe with some ladders for climbing. There's the ability to knock people off with bull rush for falling damage.

2. **2 planes** There's a hole in the ground or a ladder that connects 2 different planes with no line of sight between them. A street fight combines with a sewer fight below, for example.

3. **Chasm** Combat where a Athletics leap will get you access to an advantageous position or access to ranged attackers.   

4. **Narrow ledge** A narrow ledge must be balanced across in order to gain an advantage in the combat.

5. **Smoke or fog.** Large patches of smoke or fog obscure the battlefield. They can be light or heavy, either granting concealment (-2 to hit) or invisibilty.

6. **Creeping fire** A fire starts small at the beginning of the encounter, but grows quickly. Explosive barrels for extra fun.

# Hope's End

At the edge of the blood soaked lands of the vampire lords lies the town of Hope's End. It is a free city, not defended by any lord or count or part of any nation. It sustains itself by coin and treasure from outsiders. Hope's End citizens all came from somewhere else; no one is raising a family here. There's no graveyard (for reasons). Hope's End has been here for 20 years or so, started by an adventurer's camp, a group who called themselves Blackwatch. Blackwatch is no more, but the town stuck around.

## People

# About the Lands to the North

* Hope's End lies on the edge of undead influence. Going further north becomes increasingly dangerous.
* There are several distinct peoples in the north of the mountain, all of them now under the sway of vampire lords. 
* Folklore holds that the vampires were defeated by the gods in ancient times.
* Vampires generally rule the cities (much of them), but free peoples exist in the jungles, but increasingly less so, they are being hunted for blood and / or sport.
* Besides vampires, other groups make ploys for power.
* The dead sometimes rise on their own in these lands.
* Much of the wealth of the former rulers here is consolidated into vampire holds.

# Bad Guy Groups
* The Priest: One of the vampire lords is driven mad with divinity, believing herself to be an instrument of the Sun In The Sky, for the gods are not happy with their creation and must start again, anew. She is a butcher. Her thralls terrorize the jungles of their homelands.
* Larva Mage cult
* Necromancer group
